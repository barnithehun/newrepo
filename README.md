I THINK I GET IT NOW: COMMITING IS JUST A PREPARATION WHEN YOU ARE READY ON YOUR COMPUTER
YOU WILL ONLY UPLOAD IT ONCE YOU "PUSHED" IT --- YOU USE >Git:Push to do that


Lets se how it updtes?!


Now I uploaded a new folder just to see how to GIT things... seems to work, but to create a new file I have the following route in my mind: 
First you have to create a repo in guthub and clone it to your computer 
Then it will not that it is a githup repository
Then you can make changes to it, commmit etc...
Not sure if this is worth it for R, but defenitely does for Julia
